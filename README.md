#### Description:
Chat50 is a user-friendly text-messaging web app designed for seamless communication. It provides a simple and intuitive platform for connecting with friends, managing friend requests, and exploring new conversations.

### Features and Main Plot:

**User Registration and Login:**
Chat50 offers a straightforward user registration process. New users can easily create an account by providing essential details such as a username, password, and confirmation. For existing users, a quick login process ensures immediate access to the vibrant chatting experience.

**Home Page:**
Upon successful login, users are welcomed to Chat50's web app. The left division elegantly displays the user's profile picture, username, and a settings icon. Hovering over the settings icon reveals a dropdown menu with options like Home, Show Requests, Add Friend, and Log Out.

**Show Requests:**
Clicking on "Show Requests" unveils a list of friend requests, indicating their current statusâ€”whether they are sent, accepted, or rejected. For received requests, users can respond directly from this section, simplifying the friend request management process.

**Add Friends:**
The "Add Friends" feature enables users to search for friends by entering their username. If a match is found, a friend request is seamlessly sent. The system intelligently checks for existing requests or established friendships, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

**Chat Interface:**
The heart of Chat50 lies in its main chatting interface. This section includes a search bar for quick contact lookup and a list of contacts displayed below. Contacts are presented with profile pictures, usernames, the time of the last conversation, and the last message sent. The interface dynamically adjusts with a scrollbar if the contact list surpasses the viewport height.

**Left Division:**
Consistency is maintained across various sections with the left division, containing the user's profile picture, a settings icon, and a search section for rapid contact discovery. The contacts list dynamically adjusts with a scrollbar if needed, ensuring a smooth user experience even with an extensive contact list.

**Right Division:**
The right division adapts based on the selected section. In the "Home" setting or by default, it features a pleasant background with the Chat50 logo and creator information. In the "Show Requests" section, it displays a list of friend requests. In the "Add Friends" section, it facilitates friend searches and requests.

### Detailed User Experience:

**Search Functionality:**
The search function allows users to find contacts swiftly. As letters are typed, matching contacts are displayed, with entered letters highlighted in the usernames for clarity.

**Contact List:**
Contacts are presented with profile pictures, usernames, last conversation timestamps, and the last message sent. Unread messages are indicated by a circle with a number, ensuring users do not overlook new messages. The scrollbar dynamically appears to guarantee a smooth experience for users with a long contact list.

**Timestamps:**
Timestamps for conversations are shown in Indian Standard Time (IST) and dynamically adjust based on the recency of the conversation.

**Messages and Unseen Indicators:**
The chat interface displays messages with indicators for sent, reached, and seen statuses. Unseen messages are flagged with a circle indicator, offering users a quick overview of their chat history.
